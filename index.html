    <h1 class="title">Blobber</h1><br>
    <p>In a world built of walls and corridors, a small, curious blob wakes up. Squishy, fearless, and full of goo, Blobber has one goal: to escape the Maze — a pulsating labyrinth.<br>

As Blobber slides and squelches forward, the walls seem to react, reshaping behind them, closing off paths and revealing new ones. The maze isn't just a puzzle... it's watching.<br>

Blobber is clever. With each corner turned and passed, he grow more determined. The further in he goes, the stranger the maze becomes more silent. More still. More peaceful.<br>

Something lies at the center. Something ancient. Something calling Blobber forward.<br>

And so, Blobber presses on — one bounce at a time — through the ever-changing maze, in search of the truth... and the exit.
